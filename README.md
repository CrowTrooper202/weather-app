## Description


- A frequent traveler requested that we develop a weather application to help them plan future tripps to other cities.
- after looking at other applicationa and thier layouts it was decided to modify and adopt those to our purposes.
- unforntuatly after creating the base page trouble with the API occured and we are still working on the issue.
- while I believe I have the currect process I plan to reach out to peers in the neer future for get the code to to a workable standard.
